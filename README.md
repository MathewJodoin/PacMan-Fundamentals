# PacMan-Fundamentals
Get a working Pacman Game to Test Programming Concepts

The purpose of this project is to get a working PacMan Game.  From there we can add multiplayer/lives/levels etc. in other projects.

This game will be built completely in Java Swing.  Pacman will move through an array of JPanels until eating all of the powerpellets.

When the player is caught by ghosts a game over Panel will be displayed.

When th Player eats all pellets a You Win Panel will be displayed.

Have Fun!!!
